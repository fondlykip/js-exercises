 Welcome to my collection of exercises completed in JavaScript.

 Currently I am using Node.js to create a dev environment, and nodemon to continuously updated the server env with
 changes made to the code.

 Each exercise has its own folder, which contains an HTML file to interact with the scripts as well as the scripts themselves.

 Nodemon can be started at the start of development by running the command 'nodemon --quiet ./<exerciseFolder>/<exerciseFile>'

 Doc + 'tab' creates boilerplate with emmet in vscode.
